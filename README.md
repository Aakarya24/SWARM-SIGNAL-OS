# SWARM-SIGNAL-OS
World-wide traffic crisis is met with a low-cost, cyclone-proof solution: retrofitting signals with cheap Raspberry Pi modules. Fusing CCTV AI and citizen smartphone data, a reinforcement learning model optimizes flows in real time. Fail-safes ensure safety, while citizens earn rewards, making it a scalable, global blueprint.
